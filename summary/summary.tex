This paper showed that JM Smoothing, recommended by other researchers, can not improve the accuracy of Naturalize when using it instead of the default Katz Smoothing technique. Also some problems with the Naturalize tool are discussed including an inconsistent evaluation and the concern that Naturalizes good results are only applicable to strictly typed programming languages. Machine learning enables tools for software engineering to be theoretically usable over a wide range of programming languages. But the syntax of each programming language may change the level of effectiveness of such a model. Claiming that such a tool can be used over multiple languages should therefore be stated with care and preferably with prior evaluation. In the discussion section some possible implications are given, which would make good content for further research as there was not enough time to cover them in this paper.
