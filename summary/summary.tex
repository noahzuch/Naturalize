This paper showed that JM Smoothing, recommended by other researchers, can not improve the accuracy of Naturalize when using it instead of the default Katz Smoothing technique. Also some problems with the Naturalize tool are discussed including an inconsistent evaluation and the concern that Naturalizes good results may only be applicable to strictly typed programming languages. In the discussion section some possible implications are given, which would make good content for further research.
